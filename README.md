# Collection of Multiple Flutter Theming Issues

This is a small repo to collect and make it easier to report multiple Flutter issue found during development of FlexColorScheme v7.

The following issues have their reproduction code sample, and also the original markdown issue report text in this repository. 

 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123292 (01)
 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123308 (02)
 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123324 (03)
 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123380 (04)
 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123507 (05) ☂️ Contains 6 issues
 - https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/123615 (06)

I find it easier to edit GitHub issues with markdown editor in an IDE than doing it directly in GitHub, especially for longer issues and discussions.
