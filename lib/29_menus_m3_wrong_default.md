## TextStyles in Menus do not follow Material-3 spec

Based on Material-3 specification menus should use text style `labelLarge` (M3 14dp) for its menu items. For a `Textfield` part the default for `Textfield`should be used `bodyLarge` (M3 16dp). They currently do not always do so.

See spec: https://m3.material.io/components/menus/specs#ad796ca6-3d66-4e7e-9322-c0d93bff5423

The supplied code sample can be used to show and demonstrate the wrong text styles.

## Expect

Menu items in all menus in Material-3 mode to follow spec `labelLarge` (M3 14dp) and `TextField` part of `DropdownMenu` to follow `TextField` spec for its default text styles `bodyLarge` (M3 16dp).

### Actual

Menu items in all menus in Material-3 mode do **not** to follow M3 spec and `TextField` part of `DropdownMenu` does not follow `TextField` spec.


Currently `PopupMenuButton` does use correct spec when using `PopupMenuIem` and `CheckedPopupMenuItem`, but **not** if using it with `ListTiles`, it then uses `bodyLarge` (M3 16dp). This is discussed here: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/131609#issuecomment-1659024603

All the new M3 menus, like `MenuBar`, `MenuAnchor` and `DropdownMenu` are using `bodyLarge` by default. Changing this default will be breaking, but they are currently not according to M3 specification, see spec https://m3.material.io/components/menus/specs#ad796ca6-3d66-4e7e-9322-c0d93bff5423

The only place where new menus use `labelLarge` is the `TextField` part in the `DropdownMenu` where the input field uses `labelLarge`, but the menu that it opens uses `bodyLarge` on its items. As do all other menu in Flutter that come from `MenuItemButton` used in e.g. `MenuAnchor` and `MenuBar`, this is coming from:

https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/bd64bf5f923fa79635f2971531d9dfd717046963/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/menu_anchor.dart#L3792

The ironical part is that for the `TextField` part in a `DropdownMenu` the `labelLarge` is also wrong.

If we look at **Jetpack Compose** and what a `DropdownMenu` looks like there. We can see that the input field is actually `bodyLarge` like the default in a `TextField`. In it the items are also correctly using the `labelLarge` size like the M3 spec states for the items, so they are a bit smaller, but **do** follow the M3 spec for the items. 

The text input field then just follows the spec for the `TextField`, making it fit and match well when used together with a default styled `TextField`, which is a very common use case.

The M3 web spec is a bit vague on the correct default for the `TextField` in a `DropdownMenu`, but it is reasonable to assume that  **Jetpack Compose** gets this right, since the style also matches what is expected on the input part when a `DropdownMenu` is used in forms together with `TextField`s.


This means that **Flutter** basically has its `TextStyles` for input field and menu items in all the new menus reversed. When using the `PopupMenuButton` we only get incorrect style if we populate it with `ListTile`s, otherwise with recent changes, it is now correct. 

### First notice

The incorrect text styles where first mentioned and noted as a side topic in this issue https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/131350, it is here lifted out to its own issue.
