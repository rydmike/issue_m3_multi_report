## Issue: Cannot theme progress indicators, many properties missing

The `ProgressIndicatorThemeData` is missing many key properties from `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator` making it impossible to theme their styles.

## Expect

Expect to be able to style the `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator` with their `ProgressIndicatorThemeData` by also adding styles for properties:

- `borderRadius` The border radius of both the indicator and the linear track on a `LinearProgressIndicator`. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5d2c9d0933b9946d2eff8477edaceb9c91f61998/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/progress_indicator.dart#L291
- `strokeWidth`  The width of the line used to draw the circle on a `CircularProgressIndicator`. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5d2c9d0933b9946d2eff8477edaceb9c91f61998/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/progress_indicator.dart#L564
- `strokeAlign` The relative position of the stroke on a `CircularProgressIndicator`. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5d2c9d0933b9946d2eff8477edaceb9c91f61998/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/progress_indicator.dart#L565
- `strokeCap` The progress indicator's line ending on a `CircularProgressIndicator`. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5d2c9d0933b9946d2eff8477edaceb9c91f61998/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/progress_indicator.dart#L568

### Actual

The newer `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator` properties listed above that were added in their enhancements, e.g. in [PR #122664](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/122664) were forgotten or neglected to be added to `ProgressIndicatorThemeData` and are now missing, this is causing theming issues. 

The properties cannot be found in the latest version of `ProgressIndicatorThemeData`: 

https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/5d2c9d0933b9946d2eff8477edaceb9c91f61998/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/progress_indicator_theme.dart#L32C5-L32C5

Therefore, we cannot theme the `LinearProgressIndicator` and `CircularProgressIndicator` to their desired style.
