## (Material3) DatePicker Divider cannot be removed or styled, does not fit with custom header background

When styling the `DatePicker` header background to some other color than default surface color and using M3 mode, the `DatePicker` is left with an extra not needed `Divider` separator that looks out of place.

Run the attached sample to see the issue.

### Expected results

Expect to be able to change the background color of `DatePicker` from default, and for it too have a uniform header color, like so:

| Material 3 | Material 2 |
|------------|------------|

### Actual results

Actual result has a `Divider` that looks totally out of place when the header color is not surface colored. Only M3 has the out of place `Divider` when using none default header color, M2 mode does not.

| Material 3 - FAIL | Material 2 - OK|

### Issue cause

The `Divider` is hard coded to be shown in M3 mode and cannot be modified.

### Proposal

It needs to be possible to control the `Divider` via **widget** and **theme** properties.

* Divider should use no padding height/width, so it touches the header area. This way, it can, if so desired, also be used as a line between header and calendar area when their colors are different.
* It should be possible to change the color of the `Divider` so it can if desired be removed by making it transparent (expected case above), alternatively make it more or less prominent (below).
