## Switch proposal: Expose `_SwitchConfig` configuration

The `Switch` has many useful styling configuration options hidden in a private mixin class called `_SwitchConfig`. 

```dart
    mixin _SwitchConfig {
    double get trackHeight;
    double get trackWidth;
    double get switchWidth;
    double get switchHeight;
    double get switchHeightCollapsed;
    double get activeThumbRadius;
    double get inactiveThumbRadius;
    double get pressedThumbRadius;
    double get thumbRadiusWithIcon;
    List<BoxShadow>? get thumbShadow;
    MaterialStateProperty<Color> get iconColor;
    double? get thumbOffset;
    Size get transitionalThumbSize;
    int get toggleDuration;
}
```

The addition of it is a part of what enables the same component to change its look from Material2 to Material3, by using its internal configuration options.

These configuration options would be very useful when creating custom `Switch` design using it. For example, currently the `Switch` in Flutter can currently **not even** mimic the "official" custom switch style used in Android system settings by Google's Pixel phones, shown below:



_Android System Settings Switch Style - Recorded on Pixel7Pro_

In this design, the **Switch** thumb is fixed size, and the height of the switch is more narrow and without a border.


While we could remove the borders from the M3 Switch and even fake the `Switch` thumb being fixed sized by adding a transparent icon, we cannot change the size of the thumb radius, or even height of the `Switch` track.




_Fake fixed thumb size is doable, but size changes are not_

## Proposal

Refactor `_SwitchConfig` class to a public class `SwitchConfig` and add it as a public configuration property `switchConfig` to the `Switch` widget and its `SwitchThemeData`.  

This type of configuration class would be much in-line with current sub-config classes `ButtonStyle` and `MenyStyle`, used in many themes and widgets. Considering those name precedents, maybe a better name would be `SwitchStyle`.

A public `SwitchStyle` (or `SwitchConfig`) would need to use mixin `Diagnosticable`" and implement `debugFillProperties`, `copyWith`, `merge`, `lerp`,  `hashCode` and `operator` ==. 

It should be reasonably straight forward to do this refactoring.
